  about: [
    "Hello, I'm Mohammed Aman Bhuiyan. I am an avid researcher in the field of AI/ML, an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer, and I am actively involved in advancing research within this domain. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from North South University, earning Magna Cum Laude honors. Under the supervision of Dr. Shafin Rahman, I completed my undergraduate thesis on the Anchor Transformer for Online Temporal Action Localization, where our model surpassed state-of-the-art benchmarks.",
    "My research interests are primarily in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision. In NLP, I focus on optimizing language models for edge devices, building task-specific pipelines, and improving inference speed. In Computer Vision, I work on video understanding with temporal action localization, addressing limitations using Anchor Transformer, and designing optimized loss functions for class imbalance. Additionally, I have explored other important and emerging topics, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Reasoning Models, Agentic AI, and Diffusion Models."
